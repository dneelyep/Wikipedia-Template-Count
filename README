==========================
Wikipedia Template Counter
==========================

A quick script that counts the number of times a set of templates appears,
and outputs that data into a wikitext table. Uses pywikipediabot.

The current script contains the templates related to WikiProject Music, but
these templates can be replaced with others depending on your needs.

NOTE: Must have pywikipediabot installed and set up to use
(see here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot/Overview).
Otherwise, we can't use (unless I'm unaware of other tools) the Wikipedia API
to retreive template usage data.

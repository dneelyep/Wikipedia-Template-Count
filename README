==========================
Wikipedia Template Counter
==========================
A quick script that counts the number of times a set of templates appears
on Wikipedia, and outputs that data into a wikitext table. Uses pywikipediabot.

The current script contains the templates related to WikiProject Music, but
these templates can be replaced with others depending on your needs.

=======
Purpose
=======
The original goal was to create a script that generated a table similar to the one
at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Statistics automatically.

=====
Usage
=====
First, note that you must have pywikipediabot installed and set up to use this script
(see here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot/Overview).
Otherwise, we can't use (unless I'm unaware of other tools) the Wikipedia API
to retreive template usage data.

To generate the data, after you're logged in via pywikipediabot, run user_template_count
from the command line, while in this directory.

Your formatted table should appear in formatted_data.txt. From there, just paste the
table into a MediaWiki page and it should work.

If you want to generate data for a specific set of templates, edit the template_names
array in user_template_count and run the script.

raw_data.txt is used for receiving the data from the API.
